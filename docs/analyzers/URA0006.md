# URA0006: UdonSharp does not yet support inheriting from classes other than `UdonSharpBehaviour`

UdonSharp does not yet support inheriting from classes other than `UdonSharpBehaviour`.  
However, this analyzer is never enabled.  
Because UdonRabbit.Analyzer only targets the classes that directly inherit from `UdonSharpBehaviour`.

## Examples

```csharp
using System;

using UdonSharp;

class ExampleClass : YourClass // URA0006, but not worked correctly
{
    private void Update()
    {
    }
}
```

## Solution

```csharp
using UdonSharp;

class ExampleClass : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    private void Update()
    {
    }
}
```
