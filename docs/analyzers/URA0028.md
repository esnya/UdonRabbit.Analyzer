# URA0028: UdonSharp does not yet support user defined enums

UdonSharp does not yet support user defined enums.
However, this analyzer is never enabled.  
Because UdonRabbit.Analyzer only targets the classes that directly inherit from `UdonSharpBehaviour`.

## Examples

```csharp
enum ExampleEnum // URA0028, but not worked correctly
{
    Sync,
    NoSync,
}
```

## Solution

```csharp
using UdonSharp;

class ExampleClass : UdonSharpBehaviour
{
    private void Update()
    {
    }
}
```
