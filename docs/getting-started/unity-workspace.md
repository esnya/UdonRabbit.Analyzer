# Getting Started with UdonRabbit.Analyzer in Unity Workspace

This method ensures that a particular Unity workspace uses Analyzer regardless of the editor you use.
When using this method, it is recommended to disable Analyzer on the editor side in the corresponding workspace.

1. Download the latest UnityPackage from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mika-f/UdonRabbit.Analyzer/releases/latest)
2. Import UnityPackage to your Udon/UdonSharp workspace.
3. Re-Generate `.csproj` (Normally, you do not need to do this explicitly)
4. Happy Coding!
